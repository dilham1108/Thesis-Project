1. Hyperparameter Tuning: Implement hyperparameter tuning to find the best combination of hyperparameters.
2. Early Stopping: Use early stopping to prevent overfitting.
3. Data Augmentation: If applicable, use data augmentation techniques.
4. Learning Rate Scheduler: Implement a learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate during training.
5. Model Regularization: Add dropout layers for regularization.

Explanation of Improvements:

1. Hyperparameter Tuning: While explicit hyperparameter tuning is not shown, you can use libraries like Keras Tuner or Optuna to automate this process.
2. Early Stopping: The EarlyStopping callback stops training when validation loss stops improving, preventing overfitting.
3. Learning Rate Scheduler: Adjusts the learning rate during training to potentially improve convergence.
4. Dropout Layers: Added Dropout layers to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training.
5. Validation Split: Uses a validation split to monitor validation loss and accuracy during training.

By incorporating these techniques, the model should be more robust and potentially yield better performance on unseen data.
